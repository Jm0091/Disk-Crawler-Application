# 🗂️ Disk Crawler Application

### 🚀 Multi-Threaded Java Application for Efficient File Searching and Indexing

This project is a powerful demonstration of **parallel processing** and **multi-threading** in **Java**. It implements an advanced disk crawling algorithm that efficiently searches, indexes, and processes files across directories using **ExecutorService** and **Thread Pools**.

## 🎯 Objectives:
- 🌐 **Multi-Threaded Disk Crawling**: Developed a disk crawler using **ExecutorService** to handle parallel file searching across the filesystem.
- ⚙️ **Producer-Consumer Threading**: Implemented producer-consumer threading using **LinkedBlockingQueue**, ensuring smooth, resource-efficient operations and clean thread shutdown.
- 🧠 **Mandelbrot Set Exploration**: Enhanced the application with an exploration of the **Mandelbrot set**, demonstrating performance optimization using Thread Pools.

## 🔍 Application Description:
The **Disk Crawler Application** efficiently searches and indexes files using parallel processing techniques:
- **Thread Management**: Utilizes Java’s **ExecutorService** and **Thread Pools** to maximize CPU utilization and manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Producer-Consumer Model**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, using a **LinkedBlockingQueue** to manage task queues and synchronize threading activities.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Developed an intuitive GUI to display the crawling progress and results in real-time.
- **Mandelbrot Set Visualization**: Explored the Mandelbrot set, integrating it into the application’s GUI to showcase the visualization of this complex set using **Thread Pools** for high-performance rendering.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies:
- **Java**: Core language for implementing multi-threading and GUI components.
- **ExecutorService & Thread Pools**: Managed the parallel execution of tasks and resource allocation.
- **LinkedBlockingQueue**: Facilitated the producer-consumer pattern for threading efficiency.
- **Data Structures**: Optimized performance with efficient data structures to handle large file sets and complex Mandelbrot calculations.
